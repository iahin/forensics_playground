# Overview

To generate a hypothetical flow for playbook scripts using network graph and DFS. 

# Technique

From the figure below, many sub paths was generated based on largest weight(closely paired). The paths in list are sorted from largest sum of all connected edges weight.

EG.

Path1 = {A, B C}

Path2 = {B, D, E}

Path3 = {D, H}

Path4 = {E, I, J}

Path5 = {C, F, G}
